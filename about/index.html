<h3 id="Summer-2017"><a href="#Summer-2017" class="headerlink" title="Summer, 2017"></a>Summer, 2017</h3><p>During my final year of college, I pursued my curiosity and decided to learn and practice design. I have various design projects published on Behance, which has led to recognition and opened up many opportunities for me to immerse myself in the design world.</p>
<p>By dedicating numerous hours to tutorials and hands-on practice, I taught myself how to effectively utilize design tools and the mindset about UI/UX design. This self-directed learning has provided a strong foundation for my Mobile Development career.<br><a href="behance.net/dubydu">üîó behance.net/dubydu</a><br></br></p>
<h3 id="Winter-2018"><a href="#Winter-2018" class="headerlink" title="Winter, 2018"></a>Winter, 2018</h3><p>I got an internship at Neolab a few months before my graduation. This was an amazing journey for me as I stepped into the software development world. At the time, I was very curious about mobile phone applications, so I decided to choose iOS to start my journey.</p>
<p>Neolab used to be an outsourcing company, which meant there were a lot of projects and opportunities for me. I don‚Äôt remember exactly how many apps I developed during this time, but all I can say is ‚Äúa lot!‚Äù.</p>
<p>One of the projects that I am very proud of is Smaluna - An online service that allows users to consult with doctors, receive examinations, and get prescriptions for birth control pills. This project allowed me to work with an amazing team from our client company, Next Innovation Inc. My main responsibility in the project was to develop a chatbox feature that allows users to book appointments and talk with doctors, which is one of the most important features of the app.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://smaluna.com/">üîó https://smaluna.com</a></p>
<p>The project also gave me a chance to work deeply with some of the technologies that are very important for a mobile developer, such as RxSwift, Clean Architecture, Unit/Integration Testing, and GraphQL.</p>
<p>Besides technology, working in Japanese culture was also a very interesting experience for me, as it is so different from other countries.<br></br></p>
<h3 id="Autumn-2022"><a href="#Autumn-2022" class="headerlink" title="Autumn, 2022"></a>Autumn, 2022</h3><p>Moving forward to 2022, I joined Joblogic - The UK‚Äôs Field Service Management Software. Joblogic provides tools and solutions to efficiently manage field service operations, including scheduling and dispatching, job management, asset management, invoicing, and reporting. The software aims to streamline field service tasks, improve communication, and enhance overall productivity for businesses with field-based teams.</p>
<p>During my time at Joblogic, I played a pivotal role in developing and maintaining mobile applications. The product has been in development since 2015 and utilizes native source code. When I joined the team, our mission was to create something new and different while significantly improving the app‚Äôs performance and ensuring alignment in UI/UX/business logic between iOS and Android. To achieve this, we decided to develop Flutter Modules and seamlessly integrate them into the native source code. This decision allowed us to successfully create numerous new features for our important clients, such as AXA UK and City Plumbing.</p>
<p>My expertise also extends to working with SQLite, ensuring offline and real-time data sync, and implementing a GraphQL service for seamless client-server communication. I also built a robust survey and report forms module for complex data collection and analysis, which is adaptable to any mobile project as an internal package.<br><a href="www.joblogic.com">üîó www.joblogic.com</a><br></br></p>
<h3 id="Autumn-2023"><a href="#Autumn-2023" class="headerlink" title="Autumn, 2023"></a>Autumn, 2023</h3><p>I was tired of working in a big company with its politics, internal issues, and lack of transparency in information flow. So I decided to join startups, which led me to Post-PC Labs.</p>
<p>Post-PC is an indie team founded by an individual who has many years of experience in the industry and has worked in various big tech companies in the bay area.</p>
<p>I joined the team with the main responsibility of upgrading all the mobile apps from an early version of Flutter to the latest version and implementing various new features along with A/B Testing. Additionally, I had the chance to work directly with the founder, who has greatly helped me improve my skills in ownership and drive, which has been the most valuable experience during this time, beyond just technological skills.</p>
<p>At Post-PC, we aim to create multiple apps/websites that are self-sustaining, allowing us to profit-share with the team while enabling the product owner to earn passive income from them. Unfortunately, we have struggled to find the right product-market fit, which is why our products have not reached the right target customers.</p>
<p>One of the most important lessons I learned while working here is that no matter how good the products are, they will be useless if they do not reach the right customers. This is why it is crucial to identify our target customers before starting to build up an idea.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.postpclabs.com/#1">üîó www.postpclabs.com</a><br></br></p>
